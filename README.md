When it comes to assessing your blood circulation and detecting vascular conditions, Arterial and Venous Doppler Ultrasound is one of the safest and most effective tools available. It’s a non-invasive imaging technique that uses sound waves to check how blood flows through your arteries and veins. Whether you are experiencing symptoms like leg pain, swelling, or have a condition such as varicose veins or peripheral artery disease, this diagnostic test can help provide crucial information.
At Butler Medical Imaging, we offer expert Arterial and Venous Doppler Ultrasound in Butler, using advanced technology and a skilled team to ensure timely and accurate results.
What Is Arterial and Venous Doppler Ultrasound?
Doppler ultrasound is a special type of ultrasound that uses high-frequency sound waves to measure the movement of blood through blood vessels. While a standard ultrasound shows images of structures inside your body, a Doppler ultrasound focuses on how blood is flowing, including its speed and direction.
There are two main types of blood vessels examined with this test:
•	Arteries: Carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart.
•	Veins: Carry oxygen-depleted blood back to the heart.
The Arterial Doppler ultrasound checks for blockages or narrowing in your arteries, while the Venous Doppler ultrasound evaluates issues like blood clots or valve dysfunction in the veins.
Why Is It Done?
Doctors may recommend an Arterial and Venous Doppler Ultrasound to diagnose or monitor various vascular conditions. Some of the most common reasons include:
For Arteries:
•	Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD): Caused by narrowed or blocked arteries in the legs, leading to pain or cramping while walking.
•	Carotid Artery Disease: Narrowing in the arteries that supply blood to the brain, increasing the risk of stroke.
•	Aneurysms: Abnormal bulging in an artery wall.
•	Arterial embolism: Blood clots that may block arterial blood flow.
For Veins:
•	Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Blood clots in the deep veins, especially in the legs.
•	Varicose Veins: Enlarged and twisted veins that may cause discomfort or lead to complications.
•	Chronic Venous Insufficiency: A condition where blood doesn't flow effectively back to the heart due to damaged vein valves.
By offering Arterial and Venous Doppler Ultrasound in Butler, we help our patients get early diagnoses and better manage these conditions with confidence.
What Are the Benefits?
•	Non-Invasive: No needles, radiation, or surgical instruments involved.
•	Safe and Painless: Suitable for all ages and even during pregnancy (for some vascular checks).
•	Real-Time Information: Provides immediate insights into blood flow, which is crucial for prompt diagnosis and treatment.
•	Early Detection: Helps catch dangerous conditions like DVT or arterial blockages before they cause serious complications such as stroke or heart attack.
•	With Arterial and Venous Doppler Ultrasound in Butler, patients benefit from fast, reliable insights into their vascular health without the need for complex or invasive procedures.
Who Might Need This Test?
You might be referred for Arterial and Venous Doppler Ultrasound if you experience:
•	Leg swelling or pain
•	Coldness or weakness in a limb
•	Discolouration in extremities
•	Visible varicose veins
•	Risk factors for stroke or DVT (e.g., smoking, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, pregnancy)
If you have already undergone vascular surgery or have known vascular conditions, regular Doppler ultrasounds can help monitor your health over time.
